                Our KG program includes three levelsâ€”Pre-Kindergarten (ages
                3-4), Pre-Primary 1 (ages 4-5), and Pre-Primary 2 (ages 5-6). At
                this stage, students develop foundational skills in Islamic
                education, language, numeracy, and logical thinking through
                engaging activities in classification and measurement.
                Creativity and basic environmental awareness are also nurtured,
                helping young learners explore the world around them with
                curiosity and respect.

                Building on the early foundations, our lower primary students
                receive a well-rounded education with a curriculum designed to
                meet modern standards. With the guidance of dedicated and
                professional teachers, students gain a deeper understanding of
                language, mathematics, sciences, and moral values, solidifying
                the skills and knowledge introduced in KG.

                At this level, students further expand their knowledge across
                languages, Islamic studies, mathematics, science, computer
                science, and social studies. Our focus at this stage includes
                character development and soft skills, ensuring that students
                grow not only academically but also in terms of resilience,
                empathy, and effective communication. By the end of Grade 8, our
                students are well-prepared for the challenges of secondary
                education and beyond.
