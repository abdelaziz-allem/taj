                  Our KG program includes three levelsâ€”Pre-Kindergarten (ages
                  3-4), Pre-Primary 1 (ages 4-5), and Pre-Primary 2 (ages 5-6).
                  At this stage, students develop foundational skills in Islamic
                  education, language, numeracy, and logical thinking through
                  engaging activities in classification and measurement.
                  Creativity and basic environmental awareness are also
                  nurtured, helping young learners explore the world around them
                  with curiosity and respect.

                  Building on the early foundations, our lower primary students
                  receive a well-rounded education with a curriculum designed to
                  meet modern standards. With the guidance of dedicated and
                  professional teachers, students gain a deeper understanding of
                  language, mathematics, sciences, and moral values, solidifying

                  At this level, students further expand their knowledge across
                  languages, Islamic studies, mathematics, science, computer
                  science, and social studies. Our focus at this stage includes
                  character development and soft skills, ensuring that students
                  grow not only academically but also in terms of resilience,
                  empathy, and effective communication. By the end of Grade 8,
                  our students are well-prepared for the challenges of secondary
                  education and beyond.
